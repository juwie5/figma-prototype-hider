## Figma Prototype Hider
This extension allows you hide prototypes on the "Recents" page in Figma.

## How to use
- Click the "clone or download" button (it should be the green one close to the top right of the page).
- Download as a zip file
- Once downloaded, extract the zip file
- Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
- Turn on developer mode
- Select load unpacked, choose the extracted folder

## Issues
- It doesn't always work (especially if you move around multiple URLs in Figma)
- There's a flash because I let the file grid render first for 1 second before attempting to remove prototypes
